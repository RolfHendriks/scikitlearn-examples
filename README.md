# Scikit Learn Examples

This project collects all code samples from the scikit-learn documentation page and organizes them into Jupyter Labs notebooks. This allows us to explore the examples interactively in Jupyter Labs instead of merely reading them.

## Usage

This repository contains a complete list of scikit-learn examples as of January 2025. 

These examples were generated by crawling the scikit-learn examples page. The source code for the web crawler is included as well. If the project examples become out of date, run the generate-examples web crawler to fetch the latest examples from scikit-learn.
