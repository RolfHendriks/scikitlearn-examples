# Scikit Learn Examples

A comprehensive collection of Jupyter Labs notebooks downloaded from the [scikit-learn examples documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html). The main intent of this project is to allow us to explore scikit-learn examples interactively by using Jupyter Labs. Another intent is to create an offline reference of examples that is always readily available.

These examples were generated using a web crawler that is included in the project. If the examples become out of date, please run the web crawler to generate up-to-date examples from the scikit-learn documentation page.
