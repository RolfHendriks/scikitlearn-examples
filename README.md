# Scikit-learn Examples

Publishes a comprehensive collection of Jupyter Labs notebooks downloaded from the [examples section](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html) of scikit-learn's online documentation. The main intent of this project is to allow us to explore scikit-learn examples interactively by using Jupyter Labs. Another intent is to create an offline reference of examples that is always readily available.

These examples were generated using a web crawler that is included in the project. If the examples become out of date, please run the web crawler to generate up-to-date examples from the scikit-learn documentation page.

## Scikit-learn Datasets

This project includes a [fetch-datasets](fetch-datasets.ipynb) notebook that loads data for all [datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/api/sklearn.datasets.html) featured in scikit-learn. To keep the size of this repository reasonable, dataset data are not included in the repository. Please run the fetch-datasets notebook to download offline versions of scikit-learn datasets.

Scikit-learn datasets feature detailed documentation that goes well beyond what is available in scikit-learn's online documentation. This documentation is included in the repository.
